# Rhythm/music games list

Selected rhythm games and their initial release dates in chronological order. The general rule for my selection is games where you hit notes and FC songs. So for example Rhythm Heaven, while being an excellent rhythm game, doesn't match the criteria.

Different gameplay style = different game. This is the reason you can see some games listed more than once (such as Band Hero).

Finding this info online is a total chore so I just collected it in one place. I got three 24h-long IP bans on archive.org while doing my research.
