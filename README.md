# Rhythm Games

Selected rhythm games and their initial release dates in chronological order. The general rule for my selection is games where you hit notes and FC songs. So a game like Rhythm Heaven, while being an excellent rhythm game, doesn't match the criteria.

Different gameplay style = different game. This is the reason you can see some games listed more than once (such as Band Hero).

Finding this info online is a total chore so I just collected it in one place.
